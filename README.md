Privacy Policy Overview

Our service requires the collection of users' email addresses and names for the following primary reasons:

Credit Allocation: To allocate credits to users accurately. It's essential for us to identify individual users to ensure they receive the correct amount of credits based on their usage or contributions to our platform.
Usage Tracking: To understand how much a user utilizes our services. This information helps us improve user experience and tailor our services to better meet our users' needs.
Friend Sharing Incentives: We plan to introduce a feature that allows users to share our service with friends. To facilitate this, and to offer additional credits for sharing, we need to identify users and their referrals accurately. This ensures that both the referrer and the referred receive their deserved credits.
